        <ul>
        <li>Alpha 0.0.9: Optimized everything about the style of the webpage. Added a favicon for pc users and an icon for everyone (i can't draw)</li>
        <li>Alpha 0.0.8: Completed the 3DS mini wiki, completed (kinda) the explanation page. Added the page: Funny lines of code and Games. Now we have more JavaScript!
            But "prompt()" doesn't work. Scrapped the games.html.
        </li>
        <li>Alpha 0.0.7: Big Update! Changed the DSiS to 3DSS! Now for the 3DS! Adapted every single page to the 3DS. Visuals changed. Mobile mode! And updated HTML!<br>
        Also, created an explanation page.</li>
        <li>Alpha 0.0.6: Made some changes on the images page.</li>
        <li>Alpha 0.0.5: Updated the main page, some fixes on the images page and a new page for the 3DS systems with <s>a Rickroll</s><strong> actual content!</strong></li>
        <li>Alpha 0.0.4: The 3DS can load most of the pages! Some changes to optimize the page.</li>
        <li>Alpha 0.0.3: Added the images page! Changed the background here, also changed a little bit the style of every page!<br>
        Also the cookie button is here. Added lists. Optimized the code in the main page.</li>
        <li>Alpha 0.0.2: I added DSi Info! Just a little wiki, but in the future it will be nice!</li>
        <li>Alpha 0.0.1 was the start of all the versions.</li>
        </ul> 
        <p .class="Text_Important">I am adding to this page the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Audio Files (Maybe I can implement it, maybe not)</li>
            <li>Maybe some <s>low quality</s> excelent videos to entertain you</li>
            <li><s>In the future, some games?</s>Sadly, 3DS doesn't support JavaScript</li>
            <li>Some content that you can interact.</li>
