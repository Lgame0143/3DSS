        <h1 id="Gallery">Images for your 3DS</h1>
        <p>The 3DS can let you see images here!</p><br>
        This gallery will have a bit of everything: Since memes to photos taken by a DSi or 3DS<br>
        You can submit your <strong>own photos</strong> here! Just one rule: Take it with a DS family system. I only accept images that:<br>
        <ul>
        <li>Anything about nature or a city (not where you live!);</li>
        <li>Aren't photos with your face or family. Don't share them to strangers!</li>
        <li>Sky photos (Well, it can be nice)</li>
        <li>Drawings or any art (Stylish!)</li>
        </ul>
        In the future I will make a way for you to send photos, along with the username you have as a thanks (I can ommit it if you don't want to).
        <p>Here are some images now!</p>
        <!--Why the hell did I do tons of work on the Images page when it didn't work on the DSi?-->
