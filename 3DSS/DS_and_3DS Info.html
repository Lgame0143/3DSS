    <h1 class="Titles">A mini guide to the DS family</h1>
    <p id="Subtitle"> The DS/3DS has a lot of things that are fantastic, but if you want to make an upgrade, you came to the right place!</p>
    <p>This wiki has 2 subcategories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>DSi systems</li>
  <li>3DS systems</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1 class="Titles">DSi</h1>   
<p id="Contents-Table">This part will explain the basics to know more about your DSi, such as:<br>
  -Modding your DSi<br>
  -Online services (and where to search them)<br>
  -Homebrew apps<br>
</p>
<h2 id="Modding-DSi-things" class="Category">Modding your DSi</h2>
<p>Modding your DSi is a way to open new possibilities, and you can have more fun once you mod your console. I won't put all the steps here, but it is simple.<br>
  All you need is a:
  <li>Computer</li>
  <li>An SD card with considerable space</li>
  <li>A DSi</li>
  <li>And a guide. You can click <a href="https://dsi.cfw.guide/">here</a> using your pc (DS can't load the page)</li>
</p>
<p>With a modded console, you can (just for convenience) install Hiya CFW if you despise the Twilight menu++ menu.
  <br>Hiya is right <a href="https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/hiyacfw/installing">here</a>, go to the link with your pc. </p>
<h2 id="Online-Services" class="Category">Online Services</h2>
<p>The DS also has online services. Even though people think its dead, they are actually working (you don't need to mod your console). These are the following:<br>
-Wimmfi: Wimmfi is a service for both DS and Wii. They revive the online features of both consoles, meaning that you can actually play a Mario Kart race
or even trade pokemon, or other things. Here is a <a href="https://wiimmfi.de/">link</a> for it on the pc;<br>
-Sudomemo: Sudomemo is a Flipnote Hatena revival, and a fantastic service for people who want to draw their works of art. Here is another <a href="https://www.sudomemo.net/">link</a>
taking you there!<br>
In order to acess these online services, you need to have a WEP router (because the DSi can't handle WPA) or an internet connection with no password.<br>
After that, you need to set the DNS to manual in System Settings and change settings of that connection, and follow the links where they put their DNS (They update them, so it's better to follow with their links)<br>
After that you can enjoy your gameplay!
</p>
<h2 id="Homebrew-apps" class="Category">Homebrew apps</h2>
<p>GameBrew, a fantastic website, has a ton of fantastic homebrew that you can explore and get some fun out of it. It includes:
  <ul>
    <li>Fan games</li>
    <li>Utilities</li>
    <li>Learning</li>
    <li>Music</li>
    <li>Or quality of life improvements</li>
  </ul>
  If you want to see and download for yourself, just <a href="https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/List_of_DS_homebrew_applications">click here</a> using your pc.

<h1 class="Titles">3DS</h1>
<p>This part will explain some things about the 3DS, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Homebrewing your 3DS</li>
  <li>Online Services</li>
  <li>Where to get some apps</li>
  <li>Some tips</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="Category">Homebrewing your 3DS</h2>
<p>The 3DS can be homebrewed too, and while I am not explaining detail by detail, you can acess an updated guide <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide">here</a> to mod your 3DS</p>
<br>Your 3DS can do a lot of things if you homebrew it. such as:
<ul>
  <li>Access some homebrew apps like a youtube for the 3DS or even Netpass</li>
  <li>Dump your games to a digital version (and cheats)</li>
  <li>Backup saves and software</li>
  <li>Acess online services</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="Category">Online Services</h2>
<p>After installing cfw into your 3DS, you need to install Universal Updater, which is a store for homebrew. After that, you need the following app:</p>
<p>-Pretendo (Or the app called Nimbus): <a href="https://pretendo.network/">Here</a>, you can turn on the pretendo servers, and make an account there. After that, you have online services!</p>
<h2 class="Category">Where to get some apps?</h2>
<p>You can get apps on your 3DS in 2 ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Via FBI: You can install FBI on your 3DS. It will install anything that is .cia or .3ds, but you need to download manualy and know what to install.</li>
  <li>Via Universal Updater: Here, you can have a catalog, and a lot of homebrew to choose.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="Category">Some tips on the 3DS</h2>
<p>I have some small tips too, just for convenience:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you want to get steetpasses, use Netpass;</li>
  <li>Don't update your console <strong>BEFORE</strong> updating your CFW;</li>
  <li>Make backups regularly (or don't, it's your choice. But at least 1 each month to not lose data);</li>
  <li>For playcoins use a fast playcoin app on Universal Updater;</li>
  <li>Install hShop (Believe me. I won't say the reason);</li>
  <li>If you installed everything just like the guide said and you don't know what you did, watch videos on Youtube, don't go to the CFW yourself;</li>
  <li>Avoid removing "useless" things like root files on SD card;</li>
  <li>Avoid any homebrew that is outdated.</li>
</ul>
