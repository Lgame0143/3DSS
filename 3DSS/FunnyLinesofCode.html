        <p>I created this just for fun. Here are some comments i left on my code because it's funny:</p>
        <p><strong>"Why do i have so many ID's when they do nothing? It's not a bother, though..."</strong><br>
            -In the first versions, i didn't knew how to class something. So i have useless IDs
        </p>
        <p><strong>"I love cookies. Yum :)"</strong><br>
            -Joke about the cookie button on the main page.
        </p>
        <p><strong>"Why the hell did I do tons of work on the Images page when it didn't work on the DSi?"</strong><br>
           -I had to convert all my images 4 or 5 times to make it work on the DSi, but then i changed to work on the 3DS.
        </p>
        <p><strong>"Using this HTML for another page. Love Rickrolls"</strong><br>
           -Same thing: DSiS to 3DSS, page was exclusive 3DS features, now it needs another name.
