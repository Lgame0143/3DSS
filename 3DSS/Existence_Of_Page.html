        <p>This project was made by a student... when he was in math class.</p>
        <p>It started as a small thing (like putting funny messages) but it turned out to be this.</p>
        <p>Before being 3DSS, it was going to be called DSiS: Since this was for the DSi, some things may still be here (like the mini wiki)</p>
        <p>I wanted to contribute to the 3DS world by creating this website... And making constant changes when i learn more code</p>
